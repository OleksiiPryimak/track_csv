<h1>Track CSV Analysis</h1>

<p>This script reads data from a CSV file and calculates the total time spent on activities tagged with specific keywords. The script uses the <strong>click</strong> library for command-line interaction and the <strong>csv</strong> library for parsing CSV files.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p><code>python (location)/track_csv.py (location)/track.csv</code></p>
<p>Replace <strong>location</strong> with the actual path to the CSV file you want to analyze.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The script will print a report to the console showing the total time spent on activities tagged with each keyword. The report format is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   <strong>Tag</strong></p>
<p>10 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          #work</p>
<p>20 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          #coding</p>
<p>15 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          #reading</p>
